This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Let's load Susan's mobile phone text records and see what we can find!

```{r}
# Read the copy of the evidence file
textData<-read.csv('UnbilledMessaging.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) #stringsAsFactors is a parameter we aren't ready to deal with yet - just include for now

# Explore the data
colnames(textData)
head(textData)
```

Notice there are two "windows" generated - one for each output command. You can even do plots:

```{r}
barplot(table(textData$To))
```

Can you do the rest of the exercise as an R Notebook?

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
