# Text 'M' for Murder
Follow along with the video here: https://youtu.be/8dS5gd8cIxU
## The Case:
- Dave Johnson returned home early from a business trip on October 16, 2017
- He claims he found his wife Susan on the floor, not moving
- A man was standing over her body when Dave entered
- The suspect bolted through the rear sliding-glass doors, jumped the fence, and disappeared
- Susan Johnson wasn’t breathing when Dave called 9-1-1, and appeared to have been strangled
- A thorough search of the residence has not produced Susan’s mobile phone
- As the primary account holder, Dave was able to provide consent to search the billing information for - but not the content of - Susan’s mobile phone activity. 
- Their wireless provider has returned the records electronically, including call history, text history, and data usage
- According to Dave, his wife texted far more than she spoke on the phone
- Susan’s phone number was (703) 555-1760, and Dave’s is (202) 555-1219
- You are assigned to review the most recent records for clues as investigators seek a search warrant for the content of voicemail and texts

You have the first of the files in question - UnbilledMessaging.csv, and I've included the steps I took in the video to process the data (BarPlotting.R). Try these for yourself. What else you would like to do? What could be made better?

Remember: use the R help files (in R Console, type a question mark before the command '?read.csv' - what does that return? Why?)

## Bonus Material for RStudio users:
You have two additional files I didn't mention directly in the video (but alluded to): BarPlotting.Rmd and BarPlotting.html

Open BarPlotting.html - it should pop open your browser. This is the output of an R Notebook, and it's an awesome way for making easily reproducible investigative notes. Any other investigator can see not only what you got, but how you got there. 

In RStudio, open BarPlotting.Rmd, and see how it works. Follow the instructions, and see if you can reproduce the rest of this lesson in the R Notebook.
